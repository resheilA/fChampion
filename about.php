          <p class="my-3 pr-lg-4">
		  I take immense pleasure in humbly introducing this unique concept of Champion sports club. Having been a CA for the past three decades, it has always been my wish to help Indian sports talents realize their full potential and help them chase down their dreams. This profession has given me fame, accolades and more importantly – a sense of true achievement. Champion sports club has been my long-standing dream and is my way of giving back to our country.
</p>
<p>
During my tenure as President of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and as an office bearer of ICAI at National and Regional levels for more than a decade, I have observed one thing prominently – the ever growing reach and popularity of multiple professions including sports, although due to several factors and lack of motive and seeing sports as a curricular activity instead of a profession has led to mounting pressure on the existing infrastructure, resulting in insufficient facilities as the existing infrastructure has not been able to keep pace with the growth.
</p>
<p>
This inadequate infrastructure has been a major obstacle for athletes  in their path to achieve excellence and success. This also compels every sports person to go through several hurdles. These hurdles including some very serious reasons like, corruption, lack of respect, unfair or biased selections,lack of money and incompetent management.

</p><br>
<p>
Coupled with this,athletes also suffer from lack of venues to train and also have no proper equipment since it costs a lot , athletes  thus end up giving up on their dreams.
Under such circumstances, it is unfair on anybody’s part to expect a sports person to devote time, effort and dedication required for becoming an athlete.
Hence, I strongly felt and realised that there is a need to provide a systematic learning and training environment for the future sports person/ athletes of India, such as providing them with equipment, training, events, venue , career opportunities and infrastructure all under one roof.

</p>
<br>
<p>

With the ongoing success Of UPACA Gurukul, my vision for Champion.in  is my heartfelt effort to provide a comprehensive solution for the problems faced by athletes. The philosophy behind CSC makes it a unique concept – that which provides the fulfillment of their allround needs and facilities in the same vicinity. I am glad to present to you my brainchild Champion sports club</p>

          <p class="my-3 pr-lg-4">India is the home to many profound sports and games. The history of sports in India can also be traced back to Vedic times during the era of Ramayana and Mahabharata. There always existed a rugged competitiveness in sports like Archery, horsemanship, wrestling, weight-lifting, swimming and hunting. Gradually, there was adaptation of hundreds of sports and games from all around the globe. Now, India has established a name in almost every sports and games field to ever exist. This shows that Indians are sports aficionados and enthusiasts who are willing to dedicate their time and perseverance towards sports. For encouraging this devotion, Champion.in is established to offer the best amenities, equipment and training to the students who are willing to learn.</p>
