          <p class="my-3 pr-lg-4">
<p>I take immense pleasure in humbly introducing this unique concept of Champion.In.
Having been a CA for the past three decades, it has always been my wish to help Indian sports talents realize their full potential and help them chase down their dreams. This profession has given me fame, accolades and more importantly – a sense of true achievement. Champion.In has been my long-standing dream and is my way of giving back to our country.
<p><br>
During my tenure as President of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and as an office bearer of ICAI at National and Regional levels for more than a decade, I have observed one thing prominently – the ever growing reach and popularity of multiple professions including sports, although due to several factors and lack of motive and seeing sports as a curricular activity instead of a profession has led to mounting pressure on the existing infrastructure, resulting in insufficient facilities as the existing infrastructure has not been able to keep pace with the growth.
<p><Br>
This inadequate infrastructure has been a major obstacle for athletes in their path to achieve excellence and success. This also compels every sports person to go through several hurdles. These hurdles including some very serious reasons like, corruption, lack of respect, unfair or biased selections, lack of money and incompetent management. Coupled with this, athletes also suffer from lack of venues to train and also have no proper equipment since it costs a lot, athletes thus end up giving up on their dreams. Under such circumstances, it is unfair on anybody’s part to expect a sports person to devote time, effort and dedication required for becoming an athlete.
<p><br>
Hence, I strongly felt and realised that there is a need to provide a systematic learning and training environment for the future sports person/ athletes of India, such as providing them with equipment, training, events, venue, career opportunities and infrastructure all under one roof.
<p><br>
With the ongoing success Of UPACA Gurukul, my vision for Champion.in is my heartfelt effort to provide a comprehensive solution for the problems faced by athletes. The philosophy behind Champion.in makes it a unique concept – that which provides the fulfillment of their allround needs and facilities in the same vicinity. I am glad to present to you my brainchild Champion.in.

          <h3 class="hny-title">Evolution of Sports</h3>
          <p class="my-3 pr-lg-4">In India it was a saying "पढ़ोगे लिखोगे बनोगे नवाब खेलोगे कुदोगे बनोगे खराब"
Unfortunately till date we believe in this myth, despite of seeing many young examples of star athletes in the area of Cricket, Tennis, Chess, Archery, and Reselling. This mentality is still overshadow out interest in sports and hinder India getting more medals in international events and making us proud in compare to other countries in the globe.
To come out from this stereotype thinking Champion.In introduces as a one stop solution for aspiring athletes. We are on a mission on making sport as a compulsory subject to study not to take as extracurricular activity. Indian sports ecosystem is evolving slowly and facing many challenges like Lack of a sports culture, Lack of talent development at the base level , Limited involvement of the private sector. The CHAMPION.IN is resolving these by providing athletes a world class infrastructure, well experienced trainers and coaches, international level of sports equipment, mentorship with physical and mental wellbeing within his reach. This inspires talented athlete to inculcate a strong spirit of participation in sports which can lead India to realise its dream of becoming a sports super power.</p>
